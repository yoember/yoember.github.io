You can keep your Ember application up-to-date with a few simple steps.

### Use ember-cli-update

Update dependencies:

    $ cd your-project-directory
    $ npx ember-cli-update
    $ npm install

Test your application, if you are happy commit these changes.

Let's run the "codemods", so it will update our sourcecode to the latest standard.    
    
    $ npx ember-cli-update --run-codemods

Run your tests, check your project again. I'm sure, it will be perfect.

Done. ;)

### A few maintenance tip

You can use `ncu` (npm check updates) to see which other package is deprecated in your project.

    $ npx ncu

More details about `ncu`: <https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates>
  
Sometimes it is quite useful to clean up your project's temporary folders (`tmp`, `dist`), `node_modules`, reinitialise the lock file, reinstall all the packages and rebuild the project.

    $ rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json tmp dist
    $ npm i
    $ ember build
